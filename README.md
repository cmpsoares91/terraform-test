# terraform-test
Test project to learn [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), requested by [VAKT Global Ltd](https://www.vakt.com/).

## Test Description:
> Implement an automated solution to run Nginx on AWS. The solution must use infrastructure as code and must have a ReadMe explaining how to run the solution. Any AWS Service can be used to achieve the goal. Optional feature of resilience and scalability can be built. You are not required to produce a detailed design document. Code must be developed on GitHub and the repo must be shared with us for evaluation once ready.

## Objectives:
 - [x] Implement an automated solution to run Nginx on AWS
 - [x] Development requirements explained in the form of installation logs
 - [x] Have a Readme explaining how to run the solution
 - [ ] (**Optional**) Feature of resilience and scalability

## Requirements:
 - Have an Amazon AWS account (see: [Create an Amazon AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?nc1=h_ls)) 
 - Have Terraform installed (see: [01-terraform_installation_win.md](https://github.com/cmpsoares91/terraform-test/blob/master/installation_logs/01-terraform_installation_win.md) for Windows).
 - Have AWS IAM Credentials configured on your machine so Terraform can access the AWS APIs (see: [02-aws_iam-credential_preparation.md](https://github.com/cmpsoares91/terraform-test/blob/master/installation_logs/02-aws_iam-credential_preparation.md)).
 - Configure a RSA Key pair called `terraform-test-keys` for SSH access (see: [03-aws_rsa-key_preparation.md](https://github.com/cmpsoares91/terraform-test/blob/master/installation_logs/03-aws_rsa-key_preparation.md))
 
 ## Running the project:
 As the project is based on simple Terraform configurations we assume for the next steps that you've downloaded the repository and have the requirements (above) all set up.
 
 To execute the configuration on AWS we only need to run a couple of Terraform commands in the command line (for more info about the Terraform CLI please check their [API Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/):
  1. Initialize our working directory containing the Terraform configuration files, so in the project folder we run: `terraform init`
  1. (**Optional**) Create an execution plan, this is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches our expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state. To do this we run: `terraform plan`
  1. Apply the changes required to reach our desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan, with the following command: `terraform apply`
  1. And finally once we finished our test we should destroy our configurations to avoid unwanted expenses, by running: `terraform destroy`
  
  ## Notes:
   * I used [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) which allows a more \*NIX-like experience in a Windows environment so some of the commands used in the docs aren't fully Windows compliant, but if necessary you can use Cmder yourself or ask me for the correct command translations.
